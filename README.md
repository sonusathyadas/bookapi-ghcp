# BookAPI

## Overview
BookAPI is a .NET 8 Web API project that provides a RESTful interface for managing book data. It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books stored in a SQLite database.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **Controllers**
  - `BookController.cs`: Handles HTTP requests related to book data and implements CRUD operations.
  
- **Data**
  - `BookContext.cs`: Defines the database context for accessing book data in the SQLite database.
  
- **Models**
  - `Book.cs`: Represents the book model with properties such as Id, Title, Author, Language, Category, and PublishedYear.
  
- **Migrations**
  - Contains migration files generated by Entity Framework Core for database schema changes.
  
- **Program.cs**
  - The entry point of the application, setting up the web host and configuring services.
  
- **appsettings.json**
  - Configuration settings for the application, including the SQLite database connection string.
  
- **BookAPI.csproj**
  - Project file containing references to necessary packages and project settings.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. Run the following command to restore the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Database Migration**
   Create the database and apply migrations using Entity Framework Core:
   ```bash

   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   Start the application using:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **API Endpoints**
   The following endpoints are available for interacting with the book data:
   - `GET /api/books`: Retrieve all books.
   - `GET /api/books/{id}`: Retrieve a specific book by ID.
   - `POST /api/books`: Create a new book.
   - `PUT /api/books/{id}`: Update an existing book.
   - `DELETE /api/books/{id}`: Delete a book.
